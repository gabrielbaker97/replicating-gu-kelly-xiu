Hello# Replicating Gu-Kelly-Xiu: R to Python Translation

This repository contains a **translation of R code to Python** from the blogpost replication of the paper:

**Empirical Asset Pricing via Machine Learning**  
*Shihao Gu, Brian Kelly, and Dacheng Xiu*

The original blogpost implemented the methods in R; this project aims to **reproduce the same results using Python**, enabling easier integration with Python-based workflows and libraries.
